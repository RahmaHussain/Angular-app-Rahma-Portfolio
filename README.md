# Portfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Futuer

This portfolio is going to be a "web application" not a website because of the reasons why we prefer web apps instead of websites, loading , seamlessness etc.

The domain name will be rahma.io, we shall upload blogs leveraging django, we shall buy the domain name or find something free that is close enough to rahma.io
